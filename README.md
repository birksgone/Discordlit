### üìù Table Formatter

1.  **Copy Data**: Copy a range of cells from your spreadsheet (e.g., Google Sheets).
2.  **Paste into App**: Paste the copied data into the large text area under "Input Data".

    *   **Padding**: The number of spaces at the very beginning and end of each line.
4.  **Choose Format Style**:
    *   **Code block (` ``` `)**: Recommended for tables with multi-line text. Wraps the entire table in one block.
    *   **Inline code (` `)**: Wraps each line individually. Best for simple, single-line tables.
    *   **Add [ ] brackets**: An optional style to enclose each line in square brackets.
5.  **Convert**: Click the **"Convert Table"** button.
6.  **Copy Result**: The formatted table will appear below. The output box has a convenient copy button in the top-right corner.

## Adding a New Tool

This project is structured as a multi-page Streamlit app. To add a new tool:

1.  Create a new Python file inside the `/pages` directory.
2.  Name the file using the pattern `number_Tool_Name.py` (e.g., `3_New_Tool.py`). The number determines the order in the sidebar.
3.  Write your Streamlit code in that file. Streamlit will automatically detect it and add it to the sidebar navigation.
